# Indian Airline Industry Performance Visualization
In this project, I present comprehensive information regarding air traffic in the Indian airline industry, which is recognized as the third largest domestic airline market globally. Over recent years, significant changes have taken place, including the exit of established players and the entry or acquisition of new participants. The main objective is to examine the industry's growth in India, encompassing both domestic and international operations, while analysing the market shares of airlines in passenger and cargo transportation.

The reports included in this project also highlight the seasonal patterns observed in passenger and cargo traffic, taking into account arrivals and departures at various airports across the country.

All the data utilized in this Power BI dashboard is sourced from quarterly reports published by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which are publicly available and accessible through the provided link.
